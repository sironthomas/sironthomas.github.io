        <h2>In response to increasing amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, New York is encouraging drivers to start driving electric vehicles.</h2>

      <p>In 2022, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that all sales or leases of new light-duty passenger vehicles in New York must be a zero emissions vehicle by 2035. In the same announcement, the governor also announced sales or leases of new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles must be ZEVs by 2045.</p>

      <p>The directive comes alongside New York’s efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent by 2050. While the state still has 12 years left to meet this quota, the EV Times examined current data to figure out if the Empire state is on a good pace.</p>

      <p>In 2010 there was only one Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) station in New York. By 2023, though, this number skyrocketed to almost 1,300. </p>

      <iframe title="The Electric Slide" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-oD0y1" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oD0y1/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>DCFCs are one of the primary EV (electric vehicles) chargers. These chargers are under the classification level of level 3 charging. Along with DCFC stations, Tesla Superchargers are also in this group. As these types of chargers have a very high voltage — ranging from 400 to 900 volts — they’re commonly located in public areas. </p>

      <p>These chargers usually have cars at full battery within 20-40 minutes. These are best suited for driving on highways or to charge electric cars in a hurry.</p>

      <iframe title="NY Looks to go Green" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-RFBnQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RFBnQ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="592" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>The second-most popular level of EV charging is Level 2. At this level, chargers offer a lower end of volts as they typically produce 208-240 volts. Because of the manageable amount of electricity they can be installed in homes or in public areas like parking lots and near workplaces.</p>

      <p>As of Dec.18, 2023, New York has almost 3,600 EV charging stations set up. New York county, commonly known as Manhattan, leads the way with 389. As the third-most populous county in the state with over 1.6 million residents according to the Census and home to one of the most famous cities in the world, this number won’t be shocking to some.</p>

<p>It also may not come as a surprise that, when added up together, New York and the four other counties that make up New York City — Kings, Queens, Richmond, and Bronx, have the most amount of EVs. This is as a result of having highly congested streets and, according to New York State, helps overcome obstacles feared by many New Yorkers including range anxiety</p>

<iframe title="New York (City) State of Mind" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-QikGj" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QikGj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="746" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

<p>While Kings — commonly referred to as Brooklyn — and Queens counties have a good amount of chargers set up, Richmond — known as Staten Island — and Bronx counties have shockingly low numbers of charging stations. The Bronx has just 19 electric charging stations while Richmond has 36.</p>

<p>This may come as a result of the Bronx and Staten Island being the least populated boroughs in New York City, with 1,443,229 and 492,925 people, respectively.</p>

<p> In New York almost 85,000 EVs have been registered, which means there are approximately 43 EVs for 10,000 residents. In comparison, California — the state with the most EVs registered in the nation, had almost 1 million EVs registered in 2022. This puts them at 232 cars for every 10,000 people. </p>

<iframe title="Competition with California" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-FlfTO" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FlfTO/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="510" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

<p> Sue Fassler, Director of Sustainable Operations at ESF, said that while the steps the state and the United States have taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with EVs are important as the EV “pandora box” has been opened, public transportation will play an even bigger role in curbing gas emissions. This especially holds true as more electric buses and other heavy duty vehicles are being rolled out. </p>

<p> Another problem with preparing for the sale of solely EVs according to Fassler is there are concerns of whether the electrical grid can handle more cars being charged, especially if more Level 3 chargers are being created. </p>

<p> “EVs seem to be less environmentally impactful than a traditional gas vehicle. So I still think it is a good thing. But we really do need to talk as a society to about improving public infrastructure for public transportation” </p>
